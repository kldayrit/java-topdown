Game Description:
4th Impact features four players controlling a ship each from the corners of the screen.

The game utilizes a simple two-button control scheme, allowing players to shoot missiles with one button and turn right with the other.

Controls:

    Press the spacebar to shoot missiles at your opponents.

Game Mechanics:

    Each player starts with 4 health points.
    When a player is hit by an enemy's bullet, their health decreases.
    If a player's health reaches 0, they are eliminated from the game.
    The last player remaining, the one who survives until the end, wins the game.
    Each player can have a maximum of 4 bullets active at a time. Use them wisely!
